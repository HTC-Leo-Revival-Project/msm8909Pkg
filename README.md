## OS support notes
- Currently loading a close-to-mainline kernel is supported (see https://github.com/HTC-Leo-Revival-Project/linux)

- Windows RT isn't supported (the os doesn't have inbox support for interrupt controller and timer found on hd2)

- ReactOS support should be possible once the arm port will be fully bootable

## Loading
UEFI can be either chainloaded as a kernel from cLK, as well as flashed to boot directly from HSPL.
However flashing as a HSPL image on HD7 is more complicated
